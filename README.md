# SelfProject
This has been something that I have wanted to make for a while now.  I play a lot of video games and one of them being World of Warcraft. In this game there is a sub-game if you want to call it that. Pet battles are a big part of the game to some people me being one of them. However, I don’t do the battles often enough to remember all the teams that I, or the community, find best to bet the certain "trainer". Rather than troll the comments of different pages finding “the perfect” team to beat the certain trainer.  I would like a web app so a person could click the trainer and find a good team to beat that trainer.  A person will also need the strategy, along with that team, to beat that trainer.

##**Plan so far:**
* Get the pets through the Blizzard API.  The information will come in as JSON.
* Have users login with OAuth.  Making people use a blizzard account.  Making the site very sercure and a better community.
* Have user profiles. Have user load in their pets. What I would like to have at the start is a saved team option.  
* This will be your team that you like to use. (Maybe a place you can also put a strategy you like use).  
* Maybe use jQuery for this, Drag and drop option.
* Have a site default team and strategy for every trainer (Pandaria, Draenor trainers at the start).
