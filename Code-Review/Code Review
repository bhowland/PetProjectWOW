******************************************

Overall - Excellent
- My first thought was just how clean the app looks as soon as I ran it. Very
easy to navigate, user-friendly, but absolutely full of information in a well-
organized application. Very well done. I unfortunately don't know too much about
the topic and couldn't do any fact-checking, but I assume based on the execution
that it's up to snuff ;)

Execution - Excellent
- Runs quickly and without errors. Setup is very clean. Project is easy to
navigate.

Code Structure - Excellent
- As noted above, character pages seem to be sorted by realm, making it very
to find a particular page in the code structure. Interesting way of separating
the jsp name page from the content page for each character, but again, I think
it only makes things cleaner and easier to update.

Naming Standard - Excellent
- As above, file names accurately describe the difference between formatting
and content, and are arranged such that they are easily recognizable by type
and by structure.

Repetitive Code - Excellent
- Code structure in JSPS affords them to be very easily read and makes an
excellent standard for adding new pages or making adjustments to old ones by
filing content separate from format, with that formatting page being <10 lines
of code.

Exception Handling - N/A
- Not much handling to do with JSPS

Variable Use - N/A
- See Above

Javadoc - N/A
- No JavaDoc

Test Coverage - N/A
- No Tests, but then there isn't a lot of processing to deal with either, and the
code runs excellently.

Logging - N/A
- No Logging; see above.

Versioning - Good
- Noted in the initial commit that lots of work was done before the first commit
was pushed, and it would have been nice to see that tracked as well, but from
there on there're regular commits with accurate descriptions of the changes
made.

Method only does one thing - N/A

Efficient Code - N/A

Testing - N/A
- No Tests

Scope - N/A

Encapsulation - N/A

Properties files/Static variables - Excellent
- Spring Implementation

Security - N/A

Maintain specific class functionality - N/A

IntelliJ warnings - Excellent
- No Warnings, very clean code.

Use Modern Java techniques - Excellent
