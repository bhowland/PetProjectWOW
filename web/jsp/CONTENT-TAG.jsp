      <h2 class="title">Welcome to a WOW Pet Battle Page</h2>
        <div class="story">
        <p>On this site for the time being at least we would like to focus on the better places(imo) to level the
          wonderful little addon to the game, PETS.
        </p>

        <p>We tend to think time is important in a game like this. Even if you are "wasting" doing pet battles.
          So We tend to think going to the other places, other than Pandaria or Dranor is a bit more of a time spender
          than a leveling activity. The other plave the trainers are much more spreadout and give less experence, therefore
          we tend to skip them.
        </p>

        <p>I find it fun to have the pet not for the cuteness of them but for the persteage of have some of the rare ones.
          So with that it sort of just snowballed into a crazy mess of alot of pets here is a link to better show my pet count at
          <a target="_blank" href="http://www.warcraftpets.com/account/profiles/Toofattoswim/">Warcraft Pets</a>.
        </p>

        <p>When collecting the pet for pure count or just to collect some pets for a certian achive, I normally just stick
          to getting whatever quality of pet. It is not too uncommon to get upgrade tokens to make them a "rare".  That is
          not to say that SOME pets are not worth hunting for the rare right off but some you just wont really use to often,
          so I think why? Then others are so rare to even find the EXTRA time to find a rare truly seems silly to me.
        </p>

        <p>What we will do for every trainer on this page is give you our plan of battle for each
          tamer. Each one will be a two pet plan so you can level a pet at each tamer. We will also post
          link for each tamer incase you dont yet have the pets.
        </p>

        <p>The Pandaria menu will have the, what we feel, is the fastest way to do all the tamers.
          The order they are listed is the order we feel you should do them. Since the ledengery battles
          give little to no experiance, at this time, we will not be list ing them on this site.  The
          Draenor menus are simply in a clockwise setup. The marks will signify the nearest tamer for
          each the Alliance ahd the Horde starting zones.
        </p>

        <p>One big thing to know is that leveling two pets at the same time wont grant the same experance
          so it is a better idea to level only ONE pet at a time, even if you only need one to win.
          Remeber you hat(toy now) and leveling food for the pet.  I tend to select three pet to level for the
          day.  I also like to favorite them to find them easily while flying from one trainer to the
          next. If you use the safari hat and a basic food buff you can get nearly 3 pets in just Pandaria,
          from level one to 25. If it is the the pet event week, now we are talking 5 pets in one trip.
          If you dont have a food buff for the pet you can level 2 pets in Pandaria.  In Draenor you can level
          one pet, by doing the 6 pet tamers without a food buff, from 1 to nearly 25.
