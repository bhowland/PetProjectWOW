### Project Problem Statement and Plan

Ben, your Pet Battle web application sounds like it will be a lot of fun to build! I can see the web service integration with Blizzard, and it looks like your individual research topic will be OAuth?  

* Could you add a link/more detail on the trainer/team aspect so I can better understand the background? Supplying this in your problem statement will also help your code reviewers if they aren't familiar with World of Warcraft.  

* The next step is to create a list of specific tasks to complete your project and then lay those out in a timeline.  Some task examples to get you started: ui design, database design, class design, application flow diagrams, create database tables, build html/jsp pages, etc.  Remember that the technologies we are learning in class like Log4J, jUnit, Hibernate, etc. should be included in the plan. Also be sure to include tasks for your weekly blog/wiki/status report.

Looking forward to seeing your progress through the semester; this will be a fun one!
